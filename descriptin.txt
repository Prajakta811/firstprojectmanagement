# Reflection on Using GitHub Project Management Feature:
1) Milestones play a crucial role in setting project goals and deadlines. By grouping related issues under a milestone, we can outline our project phases, such as "Design Phase," "Development Phase," and "Testing Phase." This helps us monitor progress and stay focused on delivering key deliverables on time. Additionally, the progress tracking associated with milestones visually represents our advancement toward completion, motivating the team to reach our goals.
2)The Project Board enhances our workflow by providing a visual overview of our tasks. We use a Kanban-style board to organize issues into columns like "To Do," "In Progress," and "Done." This setup promotes transparency, as everyone can see the status of tasks at a glance, facilitating discussions during team meetings. It also encourages team members to update their progress, fostering a culture of accountability.
3)Pull Requests (PRs) are another essential aspect of our workflow. They allow team members to review code changes, discuss implementations, and ensure code quality before merging changes into the main branch. PRs facilitate collaboration and knowledge sharing among team members, as they can provide feedback and suggest improvements
